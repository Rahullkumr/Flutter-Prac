<h1 align=center>Flutter on Codespaces ‚ù§</h1>

## Device on which codespace is running is:
- run the following command - `flutter devices`
- Linux (desktop) . linux . linux-x64 . Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye) 5.15.0-1041-azure

### 1. To keep the content in the safe area
> safe area: the area other than the place where icons like - signal, wifi, notification, notch, etc live.

use `SafeArea` widget

### 2. space between Containers 
- use `SizedBox()` widget

### 3. stretch container to fill entire available space

1. use `crossAxisAlignment.stretch`

2. using height/width 
- `height: double.infinity` (for Column Widget)
- `width: double.infinity` (for Row Widget)


### 4. Learnt CircleAvatar widget
```
CircleAvatar(
    radius: 50,
    backgroundImage: AssetImage('images/me.png'),
),
```

### 5. Styling ```Text``` widget using style property
```
Text(
    "Rahul Kumar",
    style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 40,
        fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
    ),
)
```
### 6. Adding custom fonts

1. Download the font and paste inside 'fonts' folder in the app's root directory

2. Uncomment `font area` in pubspec.yaml file and edit family name and other related properties, like this
```
fonts:
    - family: Filxgirl
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Filxgirl.ttf
```
3. Use the font where needed, like this:
```
style: TextStyle(
    fontFamily: 'Filxgirl',
    fontSize: 40,
    color: Colors.white,
)
```

4. Re-run the app

### 7. Why to use `Icon` widget instead of normal `Image` widget for icons?

- `Icon widget` uses a vector graphic, which is a mathematical representation of an image, so it can be rendered more quickly and resized without losing quality. 

- `Image widget` is rasterized, which means that it is converted to a pixel-based image when it is rendered, so it will become pixelated if it is resized too much

- `Icon widget` allows you to change the color, size, and other properties of the icon. The Image widget only allows you to change the size of the image.

### Use Icon widget like this:
```
Icon(
    Icons.email,
    size: 20,
    color: Colors.black,
)
```
### 8. `Container` vs `Card` widget

- card is like a container widget but it has rounded corners and shadow along with few more properties  

### 9. `Padding()` Widget

- used to give padding to those widgets that don't have padding property like Row(), Column(), Card(), etc
```
Padding(
    padding: EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
    child: Row(
        children: [
            Text("Padding widget example"),
        ]
    )
)
```

### 10. `ListTile()` with Card() widget

- use ListTile() instead of Row() in Card() widget

```
ListTile(
    leading: Icon(
        Icons.phone,
    ),
    title: Text(
        'Rahul',
    )
)
```

### 11. `Divider()` = `<hr>`

### 12. Decoration properties of Container Widget

<img alt="decoration image" src="https://github.com/Rahullkumr/Flutter-Prac/blob/main/images/decoration.jpg"></img>

---

### 13. Expanded() widget
- it adjusts it's child a/c to the screen size.
- it's `flex` property will divide the children into ratio

### 14. Other way of using AssetImage()
`Image.asset('images/name.png')`

### 15. Deprecated widgets

- FlatButton => TextButton()
- RaisedButton => ElevatedButton()

## Different ways to make circle in flutter

1. using `CircleAvatar()` widget
```
CircleAvatar(
    radius: 50,
    child: Text('My Avatar'),
)
```

2. using `borderRadius:` property of Container widget
```
Container(
    decoration: BoxDecoration(
        borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(100),
    ),
)
```

3.  Using `shape: BoxShape.circle` property 

```
Container(
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    shape: BoxShape.circle,
  ),
)
```

4. Using the `CustomPaint` 
```
CustomPaint(
  painter: CirclePainter(),
)
```
## Let's build Stateful Apps

- whatever will change, is coded inside the `State` part of the stateful widget

- State part tracks and updates the screen as the state changes 

- `setState((){})` marks certain things dirty
> for eg: leftDice is getting changed inside setState(), so setState() will mark every part, wherever leftDice is used, as DIRTY

- `setState((){})` triggers/calls the build method and tells it that state has changed

- whenever hot reload is done, the `build()` method is called and it re-builds only those parts that are marked as DIRTY

- `Hot reload` is a feature of Flutter that allows to see the changes in code without having to rebuild the app. When a change is made to a `stateful widget`, the `dirty` flag will be set and the `build()` method will be called. This will cause the widget to be rebuilt and the changes will be reflected in the app.

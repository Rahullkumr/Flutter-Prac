    "Rahul Kumar",
    style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 40,
        fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
    ),
)
```
### 6. Adding custom fonts

2. Uncomment `font area` in pubspec.yaml file and edit family name and other related properties, like this
```
fonts:
    - family: Filxgirl
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Filxgirl.ttf
```
3. Use the font where needed, like this:
```
style: TextStyle(
    fontFamily: 'Filxgirl',
    fontSize: 40,
    color: Colors.white,
)
```

4. Re-run the app

### 7. Why to use `Icon` widget instead of normal `Image` widget for icons?

- `Icon widget` uses a vector graphic, which is a mathematical representation of an image, so it can be rendered more quickly and resized without losing quality. 

- `Image widget` is rasterized, which means that it is converted to a pixel-based image when it is rendered, so it will become pixelated if it is resized too much

- `Icon widget` allows you to change the color, size, and other properties of the icon. The Image widget only allows you to change the size of the image.

### Use Icon widget like this:
```
Icon(
    Icons.email,
    size: 20,
    color: Colors.black,
)
```
### 8. `Container` vs `Card` widget

- card is like a container widget but it has rounded corners and shadow along with few more properties  

### 9. `Padding()` Widget

- used to give padding to those widgets that don't have padding property like Row(), Column(), Card(), etc
```
Padding(
    padding: EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
    child: Row(
        children: [
            Text("Padding widget example"),
        ]
    )
)
```

### 10. `ListTile()` with Card() widget

- use ListTile() instead of Row() in Card() widget

```
ListTile(
    leading: Icon(
        Icons.phone,
    ),
    title: Text(
        'Rahul',
    )
)
```

### 11. `Divider()` = `<hr>`
